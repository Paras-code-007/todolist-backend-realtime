we will supply our main page as single page and then make ajax post request from it

dveleop this path flow data sent to server before display on frontend 
because user data matters and user request matter and we dont want any changes on frontend without reflecting it on backend therfore backend comes first

user van make changes on front by ediiting html of page source not bu using the page functionality thats why we keep a path flow like thsi req to backend then reponse wil make the changes on frontend 

this workflow add on frontend and then send data to backend is a wrong functionality
